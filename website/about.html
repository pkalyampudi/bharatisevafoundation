      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Bharati Seva Foundation is a public charitable trust dedicated to improving the quality of life 
        for the elderly, differently-abled, and under-served communities in rural Vishakhapatnam region and 
        surrounding South Indian villages. We operate strictly on a <strong>not-for-profit</strong> basis, 
        ensuring that every donation directly supports our mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our foundation was established with the vision of creating an <strong>inclusive society</strong> where everyone has access 
        to quality healthcare, rehabilitation services, and support systems. We believe in the power of community 
        compassion and work tirelessly to bridge gaps in healthcare and social services in rural areas where such 
        services are critically lacking.
